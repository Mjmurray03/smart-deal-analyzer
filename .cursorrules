# Smart Deal Analyzer Rules

## Project Context
You are building a commercial real estate investment analyzer for a finance student with no coding background. Keep code simple and well-commented.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript (use simple types)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Client-side only (no backend/database)

## Code Style
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent formatting
- Prefer readability over cleverness

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (MetricsDisplay.tsx)
- Utilities: camelCase (calculations.ts)
- Types: PascalCase for interfaces

## Important Patterns
- All calculations should handle missing/disabled inputs gracefully
- Return null or "N/A" for disabled metrics
- Use React state for form management
- Keep all logic client-side

## Before Making Changes
1. Read smart-deal-analyzer.md
2. Check existing code patterns
3. Test changes locally
4. Update documentation if needed
