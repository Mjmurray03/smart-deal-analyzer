# üè¢ Smart Deal Analyzer

## Project Overview

**Smart Deal Analyzer** is a beta AI-powered tool for underwriting small-balance commercial real estate deals ($1-10M) in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. Built by a business student passionate about CRE and AI, this tool focuses on simple deal scoring and rent roll analysis to help investors quickly evaluate opportunities in the DFW market.

The platform's initial vision centers on DFW market specialization‚Äîproviding localized deal scoring algorithms and rent roll parsing capabilities tailored specifically to Texas commercial real estate patterns and submarkets.

## üë®‚Äçüíº About

Hi! I'm Michael Murray, a 21-year-old business student passionate about the intersection of commercial real estate and artificial intelligence. This project represents my exploration of how AI can streamline CRE underwriting, starting with the Dallas-Fort Worth market I know well.

**Why DFW?** By focusing on a single market initially, I can build deeper, more accurate analysis tools rather than trying to solve everything at once. The goal is to create genuinely useful software for small-balance CRE investors in Texas.
