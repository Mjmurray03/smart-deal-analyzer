# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Deal Analyzer project is experiencing UI overlap issues in calculation-specific pages where input fields, titles, and subheaders are overlapping, causing formatting problems. Additionally, there's a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error occurring during navigation between pages, likely due to problematic useEffect hooks in Next.js components. These issues need to be resolved while preserving the calculation logic and maintaining TypeScript compatibility with Tailwind CSS styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix UI Overlap Issues in Calculator Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want properly spaced and responsive input forms on calculation pages, so that I can easily read and interact with all form elements without visual overlap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing calculator pages THEN input fields SHALL NOT overlap with titles or subheaders
2. WHEN viewing forms on mobile devices THEN all elements SHALL be properly spaced and readable
3. WHEN form sections expand or collapse THEN spacing SHALL remain consistent and non-overlapping
4. WHEN progress indicators are displayed THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with form field visibility
5. WHEN sticky elements are present THEN they SHALL NOT cover form content

### Requirement 2: Resolve Maximum Update Depth Navigation Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between analyzer pages without encountering React errors, so that I can use the application smoothly without crashes or warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between analyzer pages THEN no "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors SHALL occur
2. WHEN useEffect hooks trigger during navigation THEN they SHALL NOT cause infinite re-render loops
3. WHEN component state updates during navigation THEN updates SHALL be properly batched and controlled
4. WHEN router.push is called THEN it SHALL NOT trigger cascading state updates
5. WHEN components unmount during navigation THEN cleanup SHALL prevent memory leaks and state conflicts

### Requirement 3: Improve Responsive Design and Spacing

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and responsive layouts across all device sizes, so that the application is usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN form layouts SHALL use appropriate grid spacing with proper margins
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN forms SHALL adapt to medium screen sizes without overlap
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN forms SHALL stack vertically with adequate touch targets
4. WHEN form sections are grouped THEN each group SHALL have clear visual separation
5. WHEN sticky navigation is present THEN it SHALL account for different screen heights

### Requirement 4: Optimize Form Component Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want form components to render efficiently without causing performance issues, so that the user experience remains smooth during data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form data changes THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
2. WHEN auto-save functionality runs THEN it SHALL NOT cause UI freezing or lag
3. WHEN field validation occurs THEN it SHALL be debounced to prevent excessive re-renders
4. WHEN array fields are manipulated THEN state updates SHALL be optimized for performance
5. WHEN components unmount THEN all timers and subscriptions SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 5: Maintain Calculation Logic Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing calculation functionality to remain unchanged, so that the sophisticated metrics engine continues to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI fixes are applied THEN all files in lib/calculations/ SHALL remain unmodified
2. WHEN form components are updated THEN they SHALL continue to use existing calculation types and interfaces
3. WHEN navigation is fixed THEN calculation results SHALL still be passed correctly between pages
4. WHEN styling is updated THEN it SHALL only use Tailwind CSS classes and maintain TypeScript compatibility
5. WHEN components are refactored THEN they SHALL preserve all existing prop interfaces and data flow
