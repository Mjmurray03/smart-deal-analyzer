# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Deal Analyzer project is experiencing two critical issues that prevent proper functionality: TypeScript compilation errors in the EnhancedMetricsDisplay component and 404 errors when navigating beyond the landing page. These issues must be resolved while preserving the sophisticated calculation engine and maintaining the existing UI design standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that the application can build and run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN EnhancedMetricsDisplay.tsx is compiled THEN all JSX mapping operations SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN complex metrics are rendered THEN the component SHALL handle unknown object types safely
4. IF commented code exists THEN it SHALL either be properly implemented or completely removed
5. WHEN the renderComplexObject function is called THEN it SHALL return properly typed React elements

### Requirement 2: Implement Missing Route Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate to all calculator and analyzer pages referenced on the landing page, so that I can access the full functionality of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Start Analyzing Now" THEN they SHALL be redirected to a functional quick analyzer page
2. WHEN a user clicks on instant calculator buttons THEN they SHALL navigate to working calculator pages
3. WHEN a user selects a property type THEN they SHALL access the appropriate analyzer for that property type
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the URL SHALL update correctly without 404 errors
5. IF a route is referenced on the landing page THEN it SHALL have a corresponding page component

### Requirement 3: Preserve Calculation Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing calculation logic to remain intact, so that the sophisticated metrics engine continues to function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are implemented THEN all files in lib/calculations/ SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL continue to import and use existing calculation functions
3. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN they SHALL use the existing formatMetricValue function
4. IF calculation types are referenced THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing interfaces
5. WHEN the application runs THEN all 200+ metrics SHALL remain available for calculation

### Requirement 4: Maintain UI Design Standards

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain its current professional appearance and user experience, so that the recent UI overhaul is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are created THEN they SHALL follow the existing design system patterns
2. WHEN components are fixed THEN they SHALL maintain current styling and layout
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the Header component SHALL be consistently used
4. IF new pages are added THEN they SHALL use existing UI components from components/ui/
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the visual design SHALL remain consistent with the landing page

### Requirement 5: Implement Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation fails THEN specific error messages SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN navigation fails THEN users SHALL see appropriate error pages
3. WHEN metrics calculation fails THEN fallback values SHALL be displayed
4. IF invalid data is entered THEN validation messages SHALL guide the user
5. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the ErrorBoundary SHALL catch and display them appropriately
